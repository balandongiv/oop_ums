    "If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a `try:` block. After the `try:` block, include an `except:` statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try: \n",
    "    # You do your operations here; \n",
    "    # ...................... \n",

    "    # ...................... \n",
    "else: \n",
    "    # If there is no exception, then execute this block. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few important points about the mentioned syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single `try` statement can have multiple `except` statements. This is useful when the `try` block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also provide a generic `except` clause, which handles any exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the `except` clause(s), you can include an `else`-clause. The code in the `else`-block executes if the code in the `try:` block does not raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `else`-block is a good place for code that does not need the `try:` block's protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    fh.write(\"This is my test file for exception handling!!\")\n",

    "In Python, you can raise exceptions using the `raise` statement. The general syntax for the `raise` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here\n",
    "Exception represents the type of exception (e.g., NameError).\n",
    "args is an optional value for the exception argument. If not supplied, the exception argument is set to None.\n",
    "The final argument, traceback, is also optional and is rarely used in practice. It represents the traceback object associated with the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def functionName(level):\n",
    "    if level < 1:\n",
    "        raise \"Invalid level!\", level\n",
    "    # The code below this would not be executed\n",
    "    # if we raise the exception\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the raise statement is used to raise an exception with an optional argument, which is the level. If the level is less than 1, it raises a \"Invalid level!\" exception along with the level value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In order to catch an exception, an \"except\" clause must refer to the same exception thrown either class object or simple string. For example to capture above exception we must write our except clause as follows:\n",
    "try: \n",
    "\tBusiness Logic here... \n",
    "except \"Invalid level!\": \n",
    "\tException handling here... \n",
