This is continuation from lecture mornign

we cannot simply downgrade the bloom taxanomy. We cannot simply downgrade
the bloom when asking the question.

when we do the assessment,it is bottom up.

OBE system will produce LO attainment
The clo attainment ni yg ada arrow naik.

# Writing Learning Outcome

Minimum for undergraduate-c4-c5
master-C6
Phd-C6
formative= List down.

final exam, must set C3 and above (reason Audit only audited the exam question).
C2 only suitable for midterm.

C3 also can be asked in MCQ

clo must be graded.

we can ask student to do presentation, and we can grade them, but still grounded to our CLO. IF clo not related to communication, then u should not grade them communication-related


CLO minumum 3
Domain (congitive, psychomotor, affective) atleast two domain

# Lesson and course assessment plan

## Assessment plan
- Formative assessment == continous assessment
- Summative assessment == final exam
- Performance based assessment == project, presentation, lab, etc, role play

## Evaluation

what is the difference between assessment and evaluation?
 evaluation more on grading (raw mark, to make value judgement)

assessment is more to increase quality (attitude). we should continously give feedback to the student.

- assessment- if they fail 1st time, we can ask them to redo the quiz until they obtain good mark.

-- we allow them to redo the quiz, but we average the score over the trial

what is the CLO>> How will the student learn this this >> How will they be assessment (sama ada dorang faham x)== This what we call constructive alignment.

ASSESSMENT TYPE, TEACHING METHOD/STRATEGY BOLEH UBAH

84 for teaching (70%)-recommended maximum, 36 for assessment (assessment 30%)

- STRICKLY NO! TIDAK BOLEH TUKAR mapping PLO
- With KP Approval: tukar wording CLO grounded to PLO
- Type of assessment (quiz, midterm, exam, report writing), assesment mark perecentage
- Let say PLO based on C5, so, soalan exam kena C5 dan ke bawah. And majority soalan tu level C5.
- 1 assignment (e.g., group project) boleh cover multiple CLO
- onlline xboleh melebihi 7 mingu
- online2 activity (PTG) tu under asynchronous (contoh youtube video:10 minit video equal to 1 SLT)
- PTG SLT should between 30-70%,XBOLEH 30% LEBIH untuk online activity PTG
- Allocation of assessment mark should align with SLT (70% for exam quiz, etc)== 70 SLT. But, we have flexibility to have plus minus 10%

# Preparing Course Syllabus


-  Table4 not syllabus
- Syllabus is a  course outline
- Syllabus is all about what is the strategy, what the do and donts, what
- Syllabus is a contract between student and lecturer. and you can explain this during 1st week
- tell them the consequence of miss-assessment (dia akan dapat F for the course)

mitigation: kalau ada yg fail miss-assessment, boleh sent official email notify,

- if miss ambil assessment, juga boleh reminder untuk ambil assessment, tapi mention deduct % penalty.

- PTG-Pembelajran Teradun Gantian: You can record for replacement-especially untuk ganti kelas cuti, 40% -40% 20%

3 x 14h=42 h 
blended learning minimum 30% (bahan online)

40% material- (e.g., we can ask them to watch video and give opinion in platlet link)
40% - activity- forum, platlet,. 
20% : online assessment

To know about PTG, can back to TDa, OR ASK pusat education learning.

# Table 4

Tips. tengok verb bila buat mapping

bila buat assessment tu, kena specific (e.g., exam, mid term, quiz, etc), objective test item (mcq), subjective test item (essay)

able to do present ( orally, and in writing) == communication skill

### Assessment

- It is recommeded to have a summative CLO mark for each of the assessment.
